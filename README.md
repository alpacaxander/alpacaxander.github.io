# alpacaxander.github.io

## High level overview
The goal of this project is to create a framework or shell of a project with all the necessities of a production ready app without the app part. Ideally, I can use this as a base for future projects, but I could also just have it to practice some fundamentals.

### Data API
This blank canvas API uses [elide](https://elide.io/) which I like because it is works around defining the model of your data and defining where the data is then building the API entirely. 
- Java
- Maven
- Elide
- Liquibase

## Motivations

### Data API
API design is interesting to me because it defines the model in which the frontend uses and backend is in service of. API's are also a mature idea & technology. The good part of it being so mature is that there are really good specifications, libraries, tools, and approaches that make building an API a solved problem. For example: this blank canvas data API will use a library called [elide](https://elide.io/) which I like because it is built around defining the model of your data and defining where the data is then building the API entirely.
